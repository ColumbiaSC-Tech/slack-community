Please familiarize yourself with our basic community standards below, or see the full version at https://github.com/ColumbiaSC-Tech/slack-community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md .

*Our Standards*

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

• Using welcoming and inclusive language
• Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
• Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
• Focusing on what is best for the community
• Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

• The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
• Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
• Public or private harassment
• Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
• Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

In the spirit of organization we have several specific channels available for more focused topics. Here's a list of our current channels and their purposes (although this may change).

*Channels*

~ #announcements: Upcoming events & meetups in the Columbia area

~ #design-ux: Ask for help/critique or showoff some solid work

~ #fp: Discussion of Functional languages like Clojure, Elixir, Scala, Node etc.

~ #front-end: Discussion of front-end technologies, like JavaScript, React, Electron, Arachne etc.

~ #general: For team-wide communication and announcements. All team members are in this channel.

~ #git-fu: Discussion, questions and learnings about Git and Github.

~ #jobs: Discussion about tech jobs and companies in the Columbia area

~ #lightning-talks: Discussion about upcoming "lightning-talks" happening through screen share on appear.in/colatech

~ #open-source: Open Source Software Discussions

~ #watercooler: A place for non-professional-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels.

Now that your familiar with our community standards and channels, please come to the #general channel and introduce yourself to the community (no pressure)!

Thanks again for joining, and we look forward to meeting you!
